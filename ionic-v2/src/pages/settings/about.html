        How you ask? By leveraging your 1st and 2nd degree friend connections in order to increase your network potential! 
        For example, say you have 250 Facebook friends and each of them have 250 friends. This means, your network 
        potential is roughly 62,500 people! Chances are, a network this vast includes a diverse group of people that 
        live in all different areas of the world which you can visually see on your connection map.

    <p class="text-content"> 
        Such an expansive network of trusted connections has many applications. For instance a local friend may be 
        willing to host you abroad, meet up with you for a coffee, provide you local tips and recommendations, 
        or simply just be a contact point in case of an emergency. Having a local contact and familiar face 
        can greatly enhance your travel or moving experience and likely lead to a renewed or budding friendship! 
        Our app unlocks the potential of these connections and makes it simple and fun!
