        The folks at Travel Guru want to mutual friend introductions a reality again and on a global scale! 
        By leveraging 1st and 2nd degree connections, your network grows exponentially. 
        The average Facebook user has approximately 380 friends online. 
        This means, your network potential is 144,000 people! A wide reaching network 
        has many uses. Chances are, a network this large includes a diverse group of people that 
        live in all different places of the world. These are people with at least one common friend 
        of yours that may be willing to host you as a traveler, meet up with you for drinks, 
        provide you local tips and recommendations, or simply just be a contact point in case 
        of an emergency. Having a local contact and familiar face can greatly enhance your travel or moving 
        experience and likely lead to a renewed or budding friendship! Our app unlocks the potential of 
        these connections making it simple and fun.
