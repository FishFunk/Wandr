        <h1>Invalid Facebook Permissions</h1>
        <h4>Wandr requires the following minimum set of Facebook permissions</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>User Friends: </strong>This is a core permission that allows us to connect
            you with friends and mutual friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Public Profile: </strong>This allows the app to access your name and Facebook 
            profile image which helps verify our users and avoid bots.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Email: </strong>This is an additional piece of info used to verify a user is a real
            person and not a bot. This info is not shared with anybody.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>User Location: </strong>If granted, 
            the app will read the location info from your Facebook profile and pre-populate that info 
            into your Wandr profile. This improves user experience but is not required. 
            This does not mean we are tracking your current location! You can update your location information
            in your Wandr settings at any time.
        </p>
        <h4>If you are unable to login, please verify access to these Facebook permissions and try again.</h4>
