        Wandr was created by a team that believes  
        in the power of bringing people together, 
        wandering our world, and having new experiences.
    </p>
    <p class="text-content">
        Our vision is to grow a network of generous, open-minded, and thoughtful individuals. 
        Not just amongst your trusted 1st and 2nd degree social connections, but strangers alike. 
        The more broad and diverse the Wandr network becomes, the more connections you can make.
        Wanderers that live in all different areas of the world that you can see 
        and connect with on your "explore" tab.
    </p>
    <p class="text-content"> 
        Whether you're looking to host travellers, stay with locals abroad, 
        get insider tips, or share a coffee with a friendly face, Wandr can help you do
        so in one simple, fun, safe, and interactive experience!
